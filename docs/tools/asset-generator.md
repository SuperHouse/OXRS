# Asset Generator
## Generate a tile icon or background image payload

Use the asset generator by selecting either Icon or Background Image and entering the name you wish to use as the reference in your configurations and uploading an image. Ensure that the name you use is unique.

It is recomended to use an image sized `60px X 60px` and in `.png`format.
